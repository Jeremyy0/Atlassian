# Atlassian Discord Bot

This bot was developed as a means for tracking resource locations for the game atlas through discord.

Commands:  
To Remove: !del <tile> <resource1>,<resource2>  
To Add:    !add <tile> <resource2>,<resource1>  

To query:
  * !find <resource>
  * !whatson <tile>
  * !map <tile>
  * !darius - Just a command that posts random giphy "ew" images as a joke. 
  * !ping - sample/test code found online when i was first making bot..... Left as a reminder to never forget where I began with the bot.
